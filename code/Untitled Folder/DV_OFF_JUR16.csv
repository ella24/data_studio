"*** Note: On January 1, 2013, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) UCR Program implemented a new definition of Rape that includes incidents previously reported as Forcible Sodomy.  Therefore, beginning with the 2013 data, FDLE’s UCR modified the collection of Forcible Rape data to include forcible rape, attempted rape, and forcible sodomy. Florida has adopted a “Forcible Sex Offense” category that is not used at the Federal level.  Florida’s Forcible Sex Offenses (FSO) include forcible rape, attempted rape, forcible sodomy, and forcible fondling.  Users of this site will note that various reports will use either a Forcible Rape or a FSO category in Index Offenses.  Through the 2012 data, when Forcible Rape is presented, it includes rape and attempted rape only, while forcible sodomy and forcible fondling are included in aggravated assault to comply with Federal UCR reporting guidelines.  "
